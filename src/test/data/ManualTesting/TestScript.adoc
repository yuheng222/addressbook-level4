== Setting up

=== Downloading the app
.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `AB&B.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for AB&B.
*Important*: Ensure that you have full read/write access to that folder to ensure optimum performance of AB&B.

=== Loading sample data
. Create a new folder, named `data`, at the root folder of AB&B.
. Copy `SampleData.xml` into the `data` folder and *rename* it to `addressbook.xml`.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

== Testing

=== Addition

==== Add by fields
Adds the person in AB&B as the last index according to the currently displayed person list.

===== Test commands
These tests cover the importance of each contact field. The next few examples refer to image 1 as the avatar image added, and image 2 as the default avatar image.

. `add n/John Doe p/12345678 e/johndoe@example.com a/Blk J, John Street, #10-2103 r/default.png nokn/Peter Doe nokp/23456789 t/friend`

=== Finding
Finds persons whose names contain any of the given keywords. The keywords are case-insensitive and the order of keywords do not matter. The keyword must be complete. E.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`. Persons matching any of the keywords specified will be returned.

===== Test commands
The following commands are to add independent test data to demonstrate the `find` command.

. `add n/John Doe p/12345678`
. `add n/Detective Doe p/23456789`
. `add n/Digilent Doe p/87654321`
. `add n/Donald Doe p/98765432`
. `add n/Hermann Fegelein p/41854148`

The next few commands are to test the behaviour of `find` command.

. `find John`
. Verify that the new list displayed only shows the name `John Doe`.
. `find Doe`
. Verify that the new list displayed only shows the names `John Doe`, `Detective Doe`, `Digilent Doe` & `Donald Doe`.
. `find Fegelein John`
. Verify that the new list displayed only shows the names `John Doe` & `Hermann Fegelein`. This shows that so long any of the keywords match a part of a person's name, it will be returned.
. `find dOe`
. Verify that the new list displayed only shows the names `John Doe`, `Detective Doe`, `Digilent Doe` & `Donald Doe`. This shows that the keywords are case-insensitive.
. `find Do`
. Verify that the new list displayed is empty. This shows that only complete keywords are matched.

=== Deletion

==== Delete by Index - `delete INDEX`
Deletes the person in AB&B at the specified `INDEX` according to the currently displayed person list.

===== Test commands
. `delete 1`
. Verify that the person at the first index is deleted.
. You may vary the `INDEX` of the person to delete and verify that the corresponding person is deleted accordingly.
. You may proceed to test the delete function with any filtered list using the `find` command.

==== Delete by Name - `deletebyname NAME`
Deletes the person in AB&B with the specified `NAME`. `NAME` comparisons are case-insensitive, but require an exact match.
*Important*: Does not depend on the current person list being displayed.

===== Test commands
The following commands are to add independent test data to demonstrate the `deletebyname` command.

. `add n/Russell Ferguson p/12345678 e/russellferguson@example.com a/Littlest Pet Shop t/BestPet`
. `add n/Russell Lee p/34142451 e/russelllee@example.com a/1 Computing Drive`
. `add n/Alex Russell p/94537432 e/alexrussell@example.com a/1 Engineering Drive`
. `add n/Biskit p/83457374 e/brittanybiskit@example.com a/Largest Ever Pet Shop`
. `add n/Biskit p/83457473 e/whittanybiskit@example.com a/Largest Ever Pet Shop`

The next few commands are to test the behaviour of `deletebyname` command.

. `deletebyname russell lee`
. Verify that Russell Lee has been deleted.
. `deletebyname russell`
. Verify that the displayed person list shows suggestions of possible persons to delete as an exact match
cannot be found.

. `find biskit`
. `deletebyname alex russell`
. Verify that Alex Russell has been deleted. (You may use the `find` or `list` command) This demonstrates how
it is independent of the displayed person list.

. `list` (This is to reset the displayed person list.)
. `deletebyname bisKIT`
. This demonstrates the case-insensitivity of the `deletebyname` command and how it will update the displayed persons
list to show all matching persons. Deletion will then have to be done using the `delete` command.

=== Find contacts by tag - `filter [TAG] [MORE_TAG]...`
Filters persons who have the any of the given tags.

===== Test commands
. `filter Year1`
. Verify that all persons with tags `Year1` are displayed.
. `filter year1`
. Verify that all persons with tags `Year1` are displayed. (This is to demonstrate the case-insensitivity of the tag keyword)
. `filter Tutor Professor`
. Verify that all persons with tags `Tutor` or `Professor` are displayed.
. `list` (reset displayed person list)

=== Modify a contact's tag list

==== Edit - `edit INDEX t/[TAG]...`
Overwrites all the existing tags the contact has.

===== Test commands
. `edit 1 t/Year2`
. Verify that the person at the first index is updated to `Year2`.

==== Add tag - `addtag INDEX [TAG] [MORE_TAGS]...`
Adds one or more tags to an existing person in the address book.

===== Test commands
. `addtag 2 group1 leader`
. Verify that tags `group1` and `leader` are added to the tag list of the person at the second index.
. `addtag 2 leader`
. Verify that an error message about duplicate tags found is displayed.

==== Remove tag - `removetag INDEX [TAG] [MORE_TAGS]...`
Removes one or more tags from an existing person in the address book.

===== Test commands
. `removetag 2 neighbour`
. Verify that tag `neighbour` is removed from the tag list of the person at the second index.
. `removetag 2 group2`
. Verify that an error message about tag-not-found is displayed.

=== Selecting a person : `select INDEX`
Selects the person as specified by the index number in the most updated contact listing. Selecting a person will have his / her address location displayed on Google Maps in the browser panel on the right hand side.

==== Test commands
*Important*: Mac users will face a bug such that invalid characters will be displayed instead of the person's address in the Google Maps search interface due to font incompatibility.

. `select 4`
. Verify that the person at index 4 is selected. The selected person's card will be overlaid with a different colour as compared to the rest and can be easily identified.
. Verify that the person's address location is shown on Google Maps in the browser panel.
. For further testing, you may repeat step 1 with any index that is within the number of contacts in the address book. Then, go through steps 2 and 3 accordingly.

=== Selecting a theme - `theme INDEX`
Switches current theme to the one given by a specific `INDEX`. There are 4 available themes: Midnight, Summer, Coffee, Crayon. The default theme is the Midnight Theme. You may refer to our user guide for screenshots of the themes to see how they should look like.

==== Test commands
. `theme 2`
. Verify that the theme is switched to the Summer Theme.
. `theme 3`
. Verify that the theme is switched to the Coffee Theme.
. `theme 4`
. Verify that the theme is switched to the Crayon Theme.
. `theme 1`
. Verify that the theme is switched to the Midnight Theme.

=== Exporting data to CSV - `export`
Exports the current data in AB&B to a CSV file in the same folder as the AB&B executable. The file will be named
`AddressBookData.csv`.

===== Test commands
*Important*: Export function may encounter errors if the appropriate read/write permissions are not granted to AB&B.

. `export`
. Verify that the CSV file exists and that the data is correct. *Important*: Commas present in addresses will be
replaced with a semi-colon (;). This is to preserve the structure of the CSV file.

. Proceed to make any change to the existing data. (`add`, `delete`, `edit`, etc).
. `export`
. Verify that the CSV file is updated with any change(s) made.

. `clear`
. `export`
. The export command should fail as it will not allow empty data to be exported.

=== Backup data with the same format as the original data
Creates a copy of the current data with "-backup" appended to the file name in the same folder as the data file.

===== Test commands
*Important*: Backup function may encounter errors if the appropriate read/write permissions are not granted to AB&B.

. `backup`
. Verify that the backup file exists and that the data is correct.

. Proceed to make any change to the existing data. (`add`, `delete`, `edit`, etc).
. `backup`
. Verify that the backup file is updated with any change(s) made.
