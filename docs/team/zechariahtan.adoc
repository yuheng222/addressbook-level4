== Project: AddressBook - Level 4
AB&B is a desktop Address Book application created by Team T10-B3 in AY2017/8 Semester 1 as a CS2103T Software Engineering project. It is written in Java, and has about 6 kLoC.

This application has a GUI but most user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface), making it ideal for users who can type fast. The current features are selectively implemented to cater to administrative users.

=== Enhancement Added: Address Book Backup

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=backup]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

In the case where any mistake was made and the app was accidentally closed (thus preventing the undo command from working on the next start), the previous backup can be retrieved.

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=backup]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Proposed: Make NOK Name and NOK Phone coupled together

It does not make sense to have NOK Name without NOK Phone and vice versa.
