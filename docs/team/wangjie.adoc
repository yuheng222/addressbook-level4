=== Enhancement Added: Filter by Tag

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=filter]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

This enhancement enables the user to view a list of contacts who have the specific tag entered and helps the user to narrow down the scope of their search to locate the contact more efficiently.
It also serves as a complement to the `find` command in case the user forgets the contact's name.

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=filter]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Added: Add tag/ Remove tag

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=addtagremovetag]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

The original AddressBook - Level 4 only allows the user to edit his contact's tag list through the `edit` command, in which the new tags entered will overwrite all the original tags.
If the user wants to make minor changes to a contact's tag list, such as adding or removing a tag, but the contact has a large number of tags, the user would have to enter all the tags that he wants to keep.
Therefore, to avoid such inconvenience, the `addtag` and `removetag` commands are introduced to allow the user to tag or un-tag a person easily.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=addtag]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: Tag pane in main window

==== External behavior

A tag pane is added to the main window to display all the existing tags in the address book.

image::TagPane.png[width="500"]

==== Justification

The tag pane allows the user to know at a glance what are the available tags in the address book, so that they can perform a `filter` function with the right tag name,
and/or avoid adding duplicate tags or removing tags that do not exist.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Auto-suggestion of command word

==== External behavior

When the user starts typing the command word, a list of possible command words will be suggested below the cursor.

Example:

* When the user types `d`, `delete` and `deletebyname` will be suggested.

==== Justification

This feature facilitates typing of commands and helps users who are not able to remember all the command words.
