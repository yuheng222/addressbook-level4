== Project: AB&B
AB&B is a java-based address book application. Although there is a GUI, main interactions
from the user are done via CLI. While there are features which would benefit the general population,
we have included features tailored specifically for administrative personnel.

*Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T10-B3/main/blob/master/collated/main/AceCentury.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T10-B3/main/blob/master/collated/test/AceCentury.md[Test code]]

=== Enhancement Added: Deletion by Name

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=deletebyname]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

To allow users to easily delete a contact with their name instead of having to scroll
through the displayed person list to obtain the corresponding index. It also provides
some time saving benefits by integrating a `find` function with the deletion query in
the event that the user cannot recall the exact name of the contact to delete.

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=DeleteByNameCommand]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Added: Export to CSV

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=export]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

To allow users to easily make use of the data stored in AB&B with other applications. An example
would be to upload the CSV file into an email client as a quick and simple way to mass update
email addresses.

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=export]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Proposed: Ability to suggest frequently accessed contacts

Users may need to frequently look up a particular contact for numerous reasons. By having such a feature,
it would save them time and effort if AB&B were able to suggest or prioritise frequently
accessed contacts in the displayed person list.
