By: `Team T10-B3`      Since: `October 2017`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8. +
Make sure you have installed Java JDK 1.8.0_60 or later.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed by default. +
Do not disable these plugins. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

If this is your first time working on the project, you have to set it up by following the steps as shown below:

. Fork this repo and clone it to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not on the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands.
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> in configuring Intellij to ensure style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

Before you get started, take a short while to complete the following:

1. Understand the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 2.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. It consists of the following 6 components:

* link:#main[*`Main`*]
* link:#commons[*`Commons`*]
* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*]
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*]
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*]
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*]

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

Each of the four components, `UI`, `Logic`, `Model` and `Storage`:

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

The section below gives detailed explanation for each component.

=== Components
==== Main
`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for:

* At app launch: Initialising the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shutting down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

==== Commons
`Commons` represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

==== UI component
The `UI` component is the User Interface of the App. The following diagram illustrates the structure of UI component.

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

==== Logic component
The `Logic` component is the command executor. The following diagram illustrates the structure of Logic component.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

For example, given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

==== Model component
The `Model` component holds the data of the App in-memory. The following diagram illustrates the structure of Model component.

image::ModelComponentClassDiagram.PNG[width="800"]
_Figure 2.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

==== Storage component
The `Storage` component reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk. The following diagram illustrates the structure of Storage component.

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::DeleteByNameCommand[]
=== DeleteByName Command

The `DeleteByNameCommand` extends the `UndoableCommand` class. It enables the deletion of
a person from AB&B when given an input `Name` parsed by `DeleteByNameCommandParser`.

The class diagram of the command is shown below:

image::DeleteByNameCommandClassDiagram.PNG[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1A - Class Diagram of DeleteByNameCommand_

In _Figure 3.1A_ the `DeleteByNameCommand` class is highly
dependent on the `Person` package as well as the `Model` of AB&B.
This dependency allows it to carry out its delete operation. The `Model` of AB&B
will be directly updated within the command.

The self calls of `DeleteByNameCommand` in the `executeUndoableCommand()` method
are illustrated in the code fragment below:
```
@Override
public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
    this.personList = model.getAddressBook().getPersonList();
    ReadOnlyPerson personToDelete = obtainPersonToDelete();

    if (personToDelete == null) { // No matching name found
        provideSuggestions();
    }
    //...deletion logic...
}
```

The sequence diagram of the Main Success Scenario of the command is shown below:

image::DeleteByNameCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="1417"]
_Figure 3.1B - Sequence Diagram of DeleteByNameCommand_

The sequence of operations carried out in _Figure 3.1B_ are detailed below:

1. The `execute("deletebyname John Doe")` command is called on the `LogicManager`.

2. `LogicManager` calls the `parse` method on `AddressBookParser`.

3. `AddressBookParser` parses the command word, `deletebyname` and calls
`parse` on `DeleteByNameCommandParser` to parse the remaining argument, `"John Doe"`.

4. `DeleteByNameCommandParser` creates a new `DeleteByNameCommand`, `d`,
and returns it all the way back to `LogicManager`.

5. `LogicManager` calls the `execute()` method on `d`, a `DeleteByNameCommand`.

6. `DeleteByNameCommand` calls itself to obtain `p`, the person to delete.

7. `DeleteByNameCommand` deletes the person, `p`, from the `Model`, and generates a new
`CommandResult`, `result`.

8. The `result` is returned to the `LogicManager` which returns it back to the `UI`.

**Advantage(s)** versus `DeleteCommand`:

* Allows users to carry out delete operations regardless of the last shown list.

**Disadvantage(s)** versus `DeleteCommand`:

* Requires the exact name of the person to be deleted in order to perform a successful deletion.
* Cannot delete a person if there is another person with the exact name present in the AB&B.

In order to mitigate the disadvantages when compared to `DeleteCommand`, `DeleteByNameCommand`
also suggests possible persons with similar names for deletion. The `Model` is also updated to display the list of suggested persons,
similar to `FindCommand`.

`DeleteByNameCommand` also updates the `Model` to list all persons with matching names if
there is more than one person with the exact same name as the person to be deleted. This is an
enhancement over the traditional `FindCommand` as it will not list any other persons whose names
match part of the query. It will then prompt users to utilise the `DeleteCommand`.

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Implementation of `DeleteByNameCommand`

**Current choice:** Filter the list of persons present in AB&B and creating a
helper `Predicate`, `CaseInsensitiveExactNamePredicate`.

**Pros:**

* Filtering from entire list of persons present in the AB&B facilitates a complete search.

* Creating a helper class `CaseInsensitiveExactNamePredicate` allows for better exception
handling of `DeleteByNameCommand` to show a list of persons with matching names. It also
improves abstraction, allowing it to be maintained and updated easily.

**Cons:**

* Filtering from entire list of persons present in AB&B can be time consuming.

* Creating an additional class `CaseInsensitiveExactNamePredicate` present within the `Person` package which
is currently unused by any other function.

---

**Aspect:** Implementation of `DeleteByNameCommandParser`

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a separate command word, `deletebyname`.

**Pros:**

* Not overloading the `delete` command word, providing clear distinctions for the user.

**Cons:**

* Creating an additional and lengthier command word for the user to enter.

* Creating an additional class within the `Parser` package.

**Alternative 2:** Overload `DeleteCommandParser`

**Pros:**

* Achieving different results with the same command word.

* Removing the need for extra classes within the `Parser` package.

**Cons:**

* Parsing logic for `DeleteCommandParser` becomes more complicated.

// end::DeleteByNameCommand[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::sort[]
=== Sort mechanism

The sort mechanism mainly relies on the logic component. The primary sorting algorithm resides in `UniquePersonList` class and it is implemented very simply using a `Person` comparator.

`IndicateAddressBookChanged` event is raised by `Model` after the sorting is done to indicate that the Address Book has been modified.

`SortCommand` inherits from `UndoableCommand` and thus it can be undone or redone using the `Undo` or `Redo` commands.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the sort mechanism works:

image::SortSequenceDiagram.PNG[width="800"]


    1. User executes the `sort` command which is then parsed through `AddressBookParser`.
    2. A new `sort` command is created and it executes the `sort` method in `ModelManager`.
    3. `ModelManager` calls the internal sorting function in the `UniquePersonList` class and the person list is sorted.
    4. Lastly, the `updateFilteredPersonList()` method in `ModelManager` is invoked and it returns the result.


==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `SortCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only sorts by names of persons in the Address Book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement and more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** Functionality is limited and may not satisfy the requirements of the user. +
**Alternative 2:** Sorts persons in the Address Book by any field (e.g. sorting by email or tag), which is given as an input by the user. +
**Pros:** More flexibility for the user since he has the option to sort contacts using more fields. +
**Cons:** Harder to implement and constant updating of code is required every time a new field in the `Person` class is introduced.
// end::sort[]

// tag::theme[]
=== Select Theme mechanism

The select theme mechanism inherits from `Command` class and it cannot be undone. It relies on the `Logic` and `UI` components.
The `Logic` component mainly handles the parsing of command and posting of the `SelectThemeRequestEvent`, while the `UI` component subscribes to the event and updates the GUI accordingly.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the select theme mechanism works:

image::SelectThemeSequenceDiagram.PNG[width="800"]

    1. User executes the `theme` command which is then parsed into `AddressBookParser`.
    2. The index `1` is extracted and parsed into `SelectThemeCommandParser`, and an `index` instance is created together with a `SelectThemeCommand` object.
    3. `SelectThemeCommand` then posts a `SelectThemeRequestEvent` which is picked up and handled by `EventsCenter`.
    4. The `Main Window` of the `UI` component is then updated with the theme at the given index provided by the user.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `SelectThemeCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** User can only select themes that are provided in the themes list. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement and less prone to UI and design bugs. +
**Cons:** No flexibility since the user is unable to change to a specific colour scheme that is not given in the themes list. +
**Alternative 2:** Allow user to customise the colour scheme of the GUI using a colour palette. +
**Pros:** More flexibility for the user. +
**Cons:** Much harder to implement and UI related bugs may occur.

---

**Aspect:** Addition of `ThemesList` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** User may refer to the user guide if they wish to view the list of themes that are available for selection. +
**Pros:** Saves the hassle of implementing a new command, and the user can find out how each theme looks like by referring to the screenshots provided in the user guide. +
**Cons:** It is tedious for the user to keep referring to the user guide if he is unable to remember the index of each theme. +
**Alternative 2:** Implement a new `ThemesList` command. +
**Pros:** More convenient for the user since he can easily find out which themes are available by typing a command. +
**Cons:** It is a trivial command which may never be used since the user can simply refer to the user guide to view the list of themes.
// end::theme[]

// tag::filter[]
=== Filter by tag mechanism

The filter command inherits from `Command` class as it is not an undoable command. The mechanism involves two components: `Logic` and `Model`. The `Logic` component is in charge of parsing user inputs while `Model` updates the filtered person list based on the inputs.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the mechanism works:

image::FilterSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

As shown in the diagram, to obtain a filtered person list based on the tags entered involves the following steps:

    1. `LogicManager` calls `parseCommand` method in `AddressBookParser` with user inputs as parameters.
    2. `parseCommand` method detects *command word* `filter` and calls `parse` method in `FilterCommandParser` with the rest of inputs as parameters.
    3. `parse` method stores the tag names entered as a `List<String>`, which is used to construct a `PersonHasTagPredicate` object.
    4. `parse` then creates a `FilterCommand` object with the `PersonHasTagPredicate` object as the parameter.
    5. `execute` method in `FilterCommand` calls `updateFilteredPersonList` method in `ModelManager` by passing its predicate as the parameter and returns the result.

`PersonHasTagPredicate` determines whether a person is eligible to appear in the filtered person list. Its `test` method loops through the person's tags and returns **true** when it finds a match with the predicates' tags.

*Alternatively*, in step 3 above, the tag names entered can be store as a `HashSet<Tag>` to construct a `PersonHasTagPredicate` object. Therefore under the `test` method, `Tag` objects of a `Person` and a `PersonHasTagPredicate` can be directly compared instead of comparing `String` tag names.
// end::filter[]

// tag::addtag[]
=== Add tag mechanism

The add tag command inherits from `UndoableCommand`. The mechanism involves two components: `Logic` and `Model`. The `Logic` component is in charge of parsing user inputs while `Model` updates the person based on the inputs.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the mechanism works:

image::AddTagSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

As shown in the diagram, to add a new tag or tags to a person involves the following steps:

    1. `LogicManager` calls `parseCommand` method in `AddressBookParser` with user inputs as parameters.
    2. `parseCommand` method detects *command word* `addtag` and calls `parse` method in `AddTagCommandParser` with the rest of inputs as parameters.
    3. `parse` method creates an `Index` instance and a `Set<Tag>` instance through `ParserUtil` and then construct an `AddTagCommand` object.
    4. `executeUndoableCommand` method in `AddTagCommand` constructs a new Person with the tags added by calling its `createUpdatedPerson` method.
    5. It then invokes `updatePerson` in `ModelManager` to replace the person with the updated one.

In step 4 above, the updated tags of the person is obtained through the following algorithm:
[source,java]
----
public static HashSet<Tag> getUpdatedTags(Set<Tag> oldTags, Set<Tag> tagsToAdd) throws DuplicateTagException {

    HashSet<Tag> updatedTags = new HashSet<>(oldTags);
    for (Tag toAdd : tagsToAdd) {
        requireNonNull(toAdd);

        if (oldTags.contains(toAdd)) {
            throw new DuplicateTagException(toAdd.tagName);
        }

        updatedTags.add(toAdd);
}

    return updatedTags;
}
----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `createUpdatedPerson` in `AddCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Make the execution unsuccessful once any of the tags entered is found in the person's existing tags. +
**Pros:** It is easy to implement and it alerts the user about duplicate tags. +
**Cons:** The user will have to enter the tags again. +
**Alternative 2:** Allow the person to be updated successfully with non-duplicate tags. +
**Pros:** It might be more user friendly if a long list of new tags is entered with only a few occurrence of duplicate tags. +
**Cons:** The duplicate tag is totally ignored and not handled. Therefore, we must inform the user through the message displayed.

// end::addtag[]

// tag::export[]
=== Export

The `ExportCommand` extends the `Command` class. It allows users to export the current AB&B data
into a CSV file.

The class diagram of the command is shown below:

image::ExportCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.6A - Class Diagram of ExportCommand_

From _Figure 3.6A_, the ExportCommand depends on `java.io` to carry out the file IO operations to create the CSV file.
It also depends on the `Model` class and `Person` package in order to extract the required information to export.

The self calls of `ExportCommand` in the `execute()` method are illustrated in the code fragment below:
```
@Override
    public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
        this.currentData = model.getAddressBook().getPersonList();

        if (currentData.isEmpty()) {
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_EMPTY_ADDRESS_BOOK);
        }

        if (fileExists()) {
            deleteFile();
        }

        createFile();
        writeData();
        return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_EXPORT_SUCCESS);
    }
```

The sequence diagram of the command is shown below:

image::ExportCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.6B - Sequence Diagram of ExportCommand_

The sequence of operations carried out in _Figure 3.6B_ are detailed below:

1. The `execute("export")` command is called on the `LogicManager`.

2. `LogicManager` calls the `parse` method on `AddressBookParser`.

3. The `parse` method creates a new `ExportCommand` which returns an `ExportCommand`, `e`,
all the way back to `LogicManager`.

4. `LogicManager` calls the `execute()` method on `e`, an `ExportCommand`.

5. `ExportCommand` obtains the `PersonList` from the `Model`.

6. `ExportCommand` checks if an exported file exists. If the file exists, it will delete the file.

7. `ExportCommand` generates the exported file through a series of self calls and generates a new `CommandResult`, `result`.

8. The `result` is returned to the `LogicManager` which returns it back to the `UI`.

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Construction of Strings

*Alternative 1 (current choice):* Use `StringBuilder`

*Pros:*

* Can easily construct the `String` due to the mutability of `StringBuilder`.

*Cons:*

* Increasing dependency on external classes, specifically the `StringBuilder` class.

*Alternative 2:* Use `String` only.

*Pros:*

* Reducing dependency on additional classes.

*Cons:*

* Increasing number of re-assignments of resultant `String` is required as it is not mutable.

**Aspect:** Generating Person Data

*Alternative 1 (current choice):* "Hard-code" the data to obtain from a `ReadOnlyPerson`.

*Pros:*

* Accelerates code execution.

*Cons:*

* Increasing coupling with `ReadOnlyPerson`.

* Reducing code adaptability should new fields be added to `ReadOnlyPerson`.

*Alternative 2:* Generate person data according to the fields present in `ReadOnlyPerson`.

*Pros:*

* Increasing code adaptability should new fields be added to `ReadOnlyPerson`.

*Cons:*

* Decelerates code execution.

* Increasing difficulty and time required to properly implement.
// end::export[]

// tag::backup[]
=== Backup
The `BackupCommand` extends the `Command` class. The backup command makes use of the `getBackup()` method in `MainApp`. The `StorageManager` then uses the `backupAddressBook()` method.

The backup is stored in the same location as the original data file.

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** When to create the backup

*Alternative 1 (current choice)*: Implement a command to create backup.

*Pros:* The backup is only created when the user desires to.

*Cons:* In an unexpected circumstances, data may be lost and the user may not have backed up the data after many changes.

*Alternative 2:* on startup of the application

*Pros:* The backup is made only of a working version of the address book that the user can easily revert to.

*Cons:* On the next startup, that backup file is overwritten, preventing a backup from some time ago to be used.

*Alternative 3:* Create a backup after a fixed number of UndoableCommands.

*Pros:* This will create backups that are guaranteed to be recent.

*Cons:* More tedious and difficult to implement. User may also be running another process at that point of time. This could cause a bottleneck if there is a lot of data to be saved, and multiple backup calls are queued one after another.

*Alternative 4:* Backup every few minutes

*Pros:* Provides a very recent copy of the data.

*Cons:* More tedious and difficult to implement. With a large amount of data, the next backup will start even before the previous one is done, eventually leading to multiple backup calls queued one after another.
// end::backup[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use AsciiDoc to document our project.

[NOTE]
We chose AsciiDoc over Markdown since it provides more flexibility in formatting, even though it is slightly more complex.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally so that you can preview your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] to convert our documentation into PDF format since Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings shown in the screenshot below.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +

* Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
* Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
